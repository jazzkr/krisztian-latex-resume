# krisztian-latex-resume
This is my new resume written in TeX. It is based on a LaTeX template I found floating around the internet made by Adrien Friggeri.
## Installation & Usage
Use your choice of TeX distribution to compile PDF. I use MiKTeX on Windows. Compile using XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
## To Do
  - Write content for current job
  - Rewrite content for previous jobs to be 3 bullets or less
  - Minor formatting based on feedback
  - Make accompanying cover letter with same format
