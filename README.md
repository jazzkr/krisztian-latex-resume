# krisztian-latex-resume
This is my new resume written in TeX. It is based on a LaTeX template I found floating around the internet made by Adrien Friggeri.
## Installation & Usage
Use your choice of TeX distribution to compile PDF. I use MiKTeX on Windows. Compile using XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
## To Do
Managed on a Trello board found here: https://trello.com/b/3vPvoKkl
